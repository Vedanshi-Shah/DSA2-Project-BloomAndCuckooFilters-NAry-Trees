## Includes: <br/>
1. Application of Bloom Filters on nodes of N-Ary Trees
2. Application of Cuckoo Filters on nodes of N-Ary Trees

## Brief Idea: <br/>
1. Searching in N-Ary tree takes O(N) time by the Naive DFS/BFS algorithm. Application of filters on the tree nodes helps in searching the element better by only following the path that might have the probability of containing the element.
2. Bloom and Cuckoo Filters are probabilistic data-structures used for set membership.
3. Bloom Filters do not support deletion whereas Cuckoo Filters do.
